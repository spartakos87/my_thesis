# Proxy server topology
Here I implement topology of proxy server. In this case I have two hosts ( `clients` ) and one switch. 
I want to connect my hosts with my proxy server, for that I set a default gateway the ip address where 
my proxy is running. For proxy I use `Squid`.  The one host is the client and the other one will represent
the "site".
